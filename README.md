# Translate drupal 8 content
This module translates content entities to a desired language e.g from English to Germany.
It just wraps the code found at packagist into a drupal compatible module.

To use it you will need to add the package below:

composer require statickidz/php-google-translate-free

All credit goes to the developer that created the above package.

Note:
This module was meant for quick tests when working with multiple languages.
So it is not production ready.

The end goal is to translate all content entities with ease. 
It has only been tested on nodes and paragraphs.
